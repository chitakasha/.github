# Chitakasha: A Quantum Approach to Interconnected Systems

![Chitakasha Logo](logo.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to Chitakasha, an interdisciplinary project that aims to explore the applications of quantum mechanics in various domains such as artificial intelligence, n-body simulations, and planetary identification. Inspired by the Indra Proposal, Chitakasha seeks to understand the universe as a vast network of interconnected systems governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.
